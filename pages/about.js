        Earlier this year, I did a solo trip around Western Europe and found
        myself visiting local parks to read quite often. As a preference over
        doing the normal tourist things (which I also love doing!), but I found
        - I think the word is solace? - in being able to sit down under the sun,
        watch strangers go on about their day, and read whatever book I had in
        my Kindle.
        <br />
        That was the inspiration for this project. I wanted to create a space
        where people can share
        {/* <div>You can see the GitHub repository here.</div> */}
      </div>
    </main>
  );
}
