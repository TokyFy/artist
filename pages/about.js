          Earlier this year, I did a solo trip around Western Europe and found
          myself visiting local parks to read quite often. As a preference over
          doing the normal tourist things (which I also love doing!), but I
          found - I think the word is solace? - in being able to sit down under
          the sun, watch strangers go on about their day, and read whatever book
          I had in my Kindle.
        </p>
        <p>
          That was the inspiration for this project. I wanted to create a space
          where people can share.

      </div>
    </main>
  );
}
